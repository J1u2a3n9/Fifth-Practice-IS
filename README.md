### IMPORTANT! HOW TO USE :hammer:


## PROBLEM SOLVER AGENT ‚öôÔ∏è

### Objective Formulation:
Implement the intelligent N in dash (3, 4, 5 in dash) also known as tic-tac-toe with the algorithms MinMax, AlphaBeta Prunning and MinMaxCutof.

### Problem Formulation:


### Initial State:
A n*n size board that is empty

### Objective State:
The same board with a number and positioning of x or circles that define a winner or tie.  

### Test of Objective:
Can the program make an intelligent decision of where to put its x or circle so that it always wins or draws?

### Actions:
* Place an x or circle in an available position on the board. 




## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
You must generate an intelligent program that allows you to analyze all possible states that are beneficial against a human opponent by implementing algorithms that will make it intelligent such as MinMax, MinMax + AlphaBeta Prunning.
and MinMaxCutOff 


## SOLUTION DESCRIPTION
The program allows to generate a board of dimensions n * n that are greater or equal to three, it also allows to choose if the first player will be human or the same program which has implemented the requested algorithms, the first player is always x whether it is the computer or human and also the program always looks for the best solution so that it wins or draws against its opponent.
